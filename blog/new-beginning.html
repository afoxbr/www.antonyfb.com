<h1 id="a-new-beginning">A New Beginning</h1>
<p>I’ve made the decision to relaunch my blog. This time around, I’m doing plain static pages rather than a Django application. I don’t need the extra features and I’m on a bit of a simplicity kick right now.</p>
<p>So why am I remaking the thing from scratch rather than use the one I already had? Basically just because I needed something to get excited about and building it up from scratch sounds like more fun. It also gives me the opportunity to construct it according to my current tastes/proclivities rather than those of the Antony of several years ago. That, plus I barely used the old blog and the posts aren’t very good. I was trying to do a tech blog and I didn’t have a lot to talk about. This one will be far more broad.</p>
<h2 id="topics-ill-cover">Topics I’ll cover:</h2>
<ul>
<li>Books I’m reading</li>
<li>Politics</li>
<li>Open source/tech more broadly</li>
<li>Personal stuff/mental health/autism</li>
</ul>
<p>That should give me more than enough room to always have something to write about. Speaking of which, I’ve got a couple of posts planned that I’d like to get started on and some stuff for my other site that needs doing.</p>
<p>Toodles,</p>
<p>Antony F.</p>
